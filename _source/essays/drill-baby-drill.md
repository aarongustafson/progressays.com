To all the “drill baby drill” folks: do you know who the largest oil producer is in the world? It's not Saudi Arabia. [It's the US](https://www.statista.com/chart/16274/oil-productin-countries/). By a lot.

<!-- more -->

[The US is also a major oil exporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_exports). Do you know why? Because the [oil companies have not invested in the facilities necessary to refine US oil in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veTbuLu7znc&t=544s), so [they export US oil to other countries where they can refine it and import oil from elsewhere to refine it here](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/imports-and-exports.php).

Also: U.S. taxpayers heavily subsidize the oil industry ([$649 billion in 2017](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs)). That could cover [the cost of the Child Tax Credit (~$12–100 billion a year, depending on who you ask)](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/top-tax-priority-expanding-the-child-tax-credit-in-upcoming-economic) and still have a ton of money left over to help increase the amount of affordable housing in the US.

Oh and, collectively, the oil companies made a ridiculous amount of profit last year. [The top three alone made a record $85.6 billion in profit in 2023](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/2834541/oil-and-gas-supermajors-recorded-big-profits-in-2023/).

“Drill baby drill” has not worked, nor will it.

The shift to renewable energy sources is slow, but growing. [In 2023, clean energy jobs in the US grew by 4.9%](https://www.energy.gov/policy/us-energy-employment-jobs-report-useer) (about 2.5x the rest of the economy). Renewables are gaining ground and they’re the future. In fact, [as of 2021 there were more jobs globally in the renewable energy than in fossil fuels](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-employment-2023/executive-summary) (35 million and growing vs. 32 million and shrinking). 

Instead of investing in a dying industry — there’s only so much oil in the ground — we should be retraining folks from the fossil fuel industry to work in a rapidly expanding sector than needs their labor!
